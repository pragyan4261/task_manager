# Server Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Self-Ping Mechanism
**Problem**: The original self-ping code had several issues:
- Typo: "reloded" instead of "reloaded"
- Wrong URL: Was pinging the client URL instead of server URL
- Always running: Was running in development too

**Solution**: 
- Fixed typo and improved logging
- Uses `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable
- Only runs in production environment
- Added proper error handling
- Created `/api/health` endpoint for health checks

### 2. Environment Configuration
**Added**:
- Proper `PORT` environment variable usage
- Production-specific configurations
- `.env.example` file documenting required variables

## Environment Variables Required

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/taskmanager` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret | `your_super_secret_jwt_key_here` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment type | `production` |
| `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` | Your app's external URL | `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` |
| `PORT` | Server port (auto-set by host) | `1337` |

## Deployment Steps

### For Render.com:
1. Connect your Git repository
2. Set build command: `npm install`
3. Set start command: `npm start`
4. Add environment variables in dashboard
5. Deploy

### Key Features:
- ✅ Self-ping mechanism to prevent sleeping (production only)
- ✅ Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- ✅ Proper environment variable handling
- ✅ Production-ready configuration
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging

## Testing the Fix

You can test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Server is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
